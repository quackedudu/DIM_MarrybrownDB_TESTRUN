| MB_TESTRUN_Discarded | Cancelled and discarded codes are placed here, either because of impracticality or too broken to be fixed. |
| MB_TESTRUN_Final | Final code fitted for presentation. Credits for Abil for compilation. |
| MB_TESTRUN_FirstDraft | First draft considered by ability of execution. Deemed too complicated for data sample insertion and presentation. |
| MB_TESTRUN_Prototype | First look of Marrybrown's key entities and attributes. Early version features self-proposed entities. |
